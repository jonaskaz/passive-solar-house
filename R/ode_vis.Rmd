## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
df_ode_dirty <- read.csv("../data/ode/ode_data.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
df_ode_dirty
```

```{r}
df_ode <- df_ode_dirty %>%
  separate(col = "X.3.000000000000000000e.00.0.000000000000000000e.00", into = c("temperature", "time"), sep = " ") %>%
  drop_na()
  

```



```{r}
df_ode
```


```{r}
df_ode %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(time, temperature))
```
